# Simple-Program-with-MYSQL-DB-and-Python
Using Python and the mysql.connector to fetch data from a database.  In my case I am running MYSQL as localhost.  Since I use the database the password, and username are blank.  If you want to get the program working you need to either find someone who has a mysql db or download it yourself, and run it as a localhost.  The password encryption protocol 'mysql_native_password' is the legacy version which I am running because the code is written in python 2.7.  If you are all up to date you can exclude this part of the code. If not and you need it, make sure to change your MYSQL auth_plugin to match  'mysql_native_password' otherwise it won't work.
